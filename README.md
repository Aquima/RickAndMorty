# RickAndMorty

In this project, I follow the best practices below:
- To generate resources, I use Swiftgen.
- To perform Swift syntax linting, I use Swiftlint.
- To implement the pattern architecture, I use MVVM.
- To perform asynchronous calls, I use Combine.
- To implement the network layer, I create an HttpClient object with its custom properties and Unit Test.
- I use `commit atomic` to push my progress to the repository
- I use ViewInspector to perform unit tests for view classes.
  
# Environments Requirement:
- Xcode 15.0.
- I use SwiftPackage dependencies for the asynchronous image cache.
